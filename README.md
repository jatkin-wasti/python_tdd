# Test Driven Development
## Types of testing
- Unit testing
- TDD
### Python has several modules that we can use to test our code
- pytest
- unittest
#### Why TDD?
- Releasing a product that hasn't been properly tested can lead to financial loss or in some cases loss to life
- TDD helps us minimise the risk of failure when sending a product to production
#### Steps
- We will create a file to write our tests
- We will run the test they will all fair
- We will create a file to write our code
- We will refactor and add the code to pass the tests
